Run the program in a browser.
When the program is opened, enter a number into the input field and press the submit button to view the prime table.

I am pleased with how I implemented the prime number algorithm.
Towards the end I figured out how to improve the time complexity and if I had more time I am sure I could improve it even more.

I am also pleased with the method I used to create the prime table. Rather than iterate over a whole 2D-array and caluclate each value
I wrote a function that mirrors one side of the array across the diagonal.
